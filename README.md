# ViT-Playground-2.0
A practical and flexible testbed for Vision Transformers and other large Transformer backbones for training, fine-tuning, LoRA-PEFT, testing, and debugging. This is my personal test codebase, supporting everything from high-end A100 multi-GPU clusters, SLURM-based HPC environments to simple debugging on my local M4 MacBook CPU-only setups.
